# Vaccines-Prediction

This project aims to predict individuals' likelihood of receiving both XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines using a dataset encompassing demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based features.Welcome to the Multi-Output Classification with Random Forest project! This repository focuses on building a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier wrapped with MultiOutputClassifier to tackle a multi-output classification problem. The model is trained to predict probabilities rather than binary outcomes. Evaluation is based on ROC AUC scores, ensuring robust performance assessment for each vaccine category independently.
